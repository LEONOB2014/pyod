Known Issues
============

This is the central place to track known issues. There are some known dependency
procedures listed in `installation <https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_.


Matplotlib on MacOS
-------------------

PyOD examples depend on Matplotlib, which may throw errors in conda
virtual environment on mac OS. See `mac_matplotlib <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/issues/6>`_.


Neural Networks
---------------

Neural-net installation related questions could be found: `FAQ <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/wiki/Setting-up-Keras-and-Tensorflow-for-Neural-net-Based-models>`_

SO_GAAL and MO_GAAL may only work under Python 3.5+.


XGBOD & XGBoost
---------------

Similarly, XGBOD would not run without xgboost installed. See installation section for more information.
